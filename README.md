# House Price Prediction Web Application

## Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application for predicting house prices in the Bangalore area. The application uses a linear regression machine learning algorithm to predict house prices based on features such as the number of bathrooms, bedrooms, area in square feet, and location. The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 88-92% in predicting house prices.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Handles real-world data with loading, filtering, and cleaning processes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhances the dataset by creating useful features.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Optimizes the dataset for better performance.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
- **Web Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface developed with Flask and Bootstrap for users to input house details and get predictions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for the application.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for responsive design.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library.
